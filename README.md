# Amethyst Menu Experiment

Little experiment repository to create an application with a menu using [Amethyst](https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst).

Run with `cargo run`.

Clicking **Start Game** overlays a new `State`. I actually thought this should completely hide the menu underneath it.

Clicking **Exit** exits the program.
